#Exercise 1: Write a program that takes a number from the input, compares it to 10, and returns a message for each of the 3 modes (larger, equal, and smaller).

#Bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Please enter a number:"
read num

if [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "The number $num is larger than 10."
elif [ "$num" -lt 10 ]; then
  echo "The number $num is smaller than 10."
else
  echo "The number $num is equal to 10."
fi
